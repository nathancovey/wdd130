    <h2>Nathan Covey</h2>
    <p>Hello world! My name is Nathan Covey and I'm in my final semester (finally ðŸ™Œ) of the BS in Applied Business Management. After graduating I plan on starting my own business. My hobbies include basketball, cooking pizza, and making videos. I live with my wife in Savannah, Georgia, which is a great place to visit on the east coast if you're ever wanting to come here.</p>
    <p>I actually have years of designing websites using no code tools such as Webflow, Wordpress, and Squarespace. You can see some of my favorite websites I've created in the list below. Although I am confident in my abilities, I want to better understand the code behind these amazing tools. I think it will help me take my work to the next level.</p>
