        Welcome! My name is Nathan Covey and I'm so glad you made it here. On this site, you will find relevant information about my background, experience, and skills.
      </p>
      <h4>Experience</h4>
      <p>
        From October 2021 to July 2023 I worked as the VP of Marketing at a startup called Galvan, a blockchain-based health ecosystem that empowers users to track and get rewarded for taking care of their mental and physical health. During my time here, I planned and executed GTM strategy that generated $2,000,000 revenue in first year, grew Web3 community to 10,000+ individuals on Discord and Twitter, managed team of five marketers to achieve KPIs, and collaborated with product and engineering teams from prototype to production.
      </p>

      <p>
        From October 2020 to October 2021, two fellow co-founders and I created a startup called HappySol, which used AI science-based technology to analyze the tones in your voice and show your levels of stress, well-being, and sleep quality. During that year, I was in charge of creating a innovative iOS/Android mental health app through strategic product development and customer research. As CEO, I also led our fundraising efforts which resulted in an acquisition by Galvan after 1 year of operations.
      </p>

      <p>
        From July 2017 until the present day, I have worked in various positions for a charity founded by my family called Bridle Up Hope: The Rachel Covey Foundation, which is changing the lives of women and girls through equestrian-assisted learning (EAL) with The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People integrated throughout. To date, 2,000 participants have passed through our stables and 90% call it "life-changing." We have also expanded to 10+ global locations, with a vision to eventually reach 1,000. As a co-founder of the organization, I continue to assist on a monthly basis with its marketing and growth efforts. Through the years, I have developed a Facebook Ads funnel with an average 8:1 ROAS, assisted in marketing and donation campaigns that have reached $3,000,000+ in contributions to date, built the website and technology platform that supports 10+ global locations in 5 different languages, implemented strategy that has generated 200+ 5-star reviews to date, grew social media following to 10,000+ in 6 months, and launched ecommerce charity shop that generates, on average, $100,000 revenue/year.
      </p>

      <h4>Skills</h4>
      <p>
        My skills include: Digital Marketing (Funnel Wizard!), Content Creation (Video, Copy), Product Development (Figma), PPC Advertising (Google, Meta),SEO (Ahrefs, Semrush), Web Development (Webflow),Design (Canva, Adobe CC), Analytics (GA4 & GTM),Email/SMS Campaigns, Organized and Detail-Oriented, Deep Web3 Knowledge, and Spanish (full prof. proficiency)
      </p>

      <h4>Education</h4>
      <p>
        I started college at Brigham Young University, where I received a half-tuition scholarship and was accepted into the nationally-ranked Entrepreneurship major. HappySol was acquired by Galvan while my time there, at which time I made the difficult decision to work full time and transfer to an online school.
      </p>

      <p>
        The school I transferred to is Brigham Young University-Idaho, where I will graduate in April 2024 with a Bachelor's of Science in Applied Business management.
      </p>

      <h4>Volunteering</h4>

      <p>
        From July 2018 to April 2020, I was a full-time volunteer missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints for two years in Buenos Aires, Argentina. During these two years, I volunteered 70 hours a week, preaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ and serving those in need, learned fluent Spanish and presented workshops/trainings on a weekly basis, immersed myself in various LATAM cultures (Argentine, Chilean, Peruvian, etc.), and led a church organization of 200 young adults and improved KPIs by 30%.
